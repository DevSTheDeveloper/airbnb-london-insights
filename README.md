# Airbnb London Price Prediction

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices in London. Using a dataset of listings with features like room type, location and availability, the model estimates nightly prices for listings.

## Features Used

- Room type (encoded)
- Minimum nights
- Number of reviews
- Reviews per month
- Calculated host listings count
- Availability (days per year)
- Latitude and longitude (with zonal encoding)
- Borough weight (a score representing average house prices by borough)

## Model

A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the log-transformed prices to better handle the skewed price distribution. The model aims to accurately predict listing prices while handling data noise and outliers. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html

## Results

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score

These metrics evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting prices.

## Dataset

The data used for this project is sourced from Inside Airbnb, which provides publicly available scraped Airbnb listing data. The dataset includes detailed information on listings in London and is updated regularly. https://insideairbnb.com
